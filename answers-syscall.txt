1. Infer the caller from the backtrace, what function called syscall()
usertrap() in kernel/trap.c
The code in trampoline.S will load the kernel stack and registers from the kernel frame and 
jump to usertrap to start executing in kernel mode.

2. p->trapframe->a7 contains the number of the syscall. 
When userspace does ecall to trap into kernel, the kernel will look at the number in a7 
and find the corresponding syscall.
